This bot is an automated tool designed to help maintain repositories by identifying and notifying about stagnant code files
that might require review. It assists in keeping your projects up-to-date and promotes regular code reviews to ensure code quality.

## How It Works

CodeReviewBot analyzes the commit history of files within your repository to identify files that have not been modified
for a certain period of time. When it detects such stagnant files, it creates an issue within the repository, suggesting that a
code review may be needed for those files.

## Features

- Automated identification of stagnant code files.
- Creation of issues for files that haven't been modified recently.
- Customizable time threshold for considering files as stagnant.
- Helps maintain code quality by encouraging regular reviews.
- Reduces the risk of having outdated or unmaintained code.
