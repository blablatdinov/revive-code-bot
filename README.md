# Revive code bot

This bot is an automated tool designed to help maintain repositories by identifying and notifying about stagnant code files
that might require review. It assists in keeping your projects up-to-date and promotes regular code reviews to ensure code quality.

## How It Works

CodeReviewBot analyzes the commit history of files within your repository to identify files that have not been modified
for a certain period of time. When it detects such stagnant files, it creates an issue within the repository, suggesting that a
code review may be needed for those files.

## Features

- Automated identification of stagnant code files.
- Creation of issues for files that haven't been modified recently.
- Customizable time threshold for considering files as stagnant.
- Helps maintain code quality by encouraging regular reviews.
- Reduces the risk of having outdated or unmaintained code.
