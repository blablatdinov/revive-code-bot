        This bot is an automated tool designed to help maintain repositories by
        identifying and notifying about stagnant code files that might require
        review. It assists in keeping your projects up-to-date and promotes
        regular code reviews to ensure code quality.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        CodeReviewBot analyzes the commit history of files within your repository to identify files that have not been
        modified for a certain period of time. When it detects such stagnant files, it creates an issue within the
        repository, suggesting that a code review may be needed for those files.
